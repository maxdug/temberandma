# **Remesh** Research through conversation
## **Freelance |** Animation
## **Date |** May & June 2018  
Remesh uses artificial intelligence to analyze audiences responses and draw out insights to an organizationâ€™s success. They brought me in to animate a conversation on their platform - showing both the moderator and participant experience. Working with their team, I took time to understand the key features and value of their product, before moving into the work of storyboarding the video. I worked with their design team to translate all their major elements from sketch files to After Effects.
