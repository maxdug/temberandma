# **United Wholesale Mortgage** Adaptive Dashboard
## **Fluid** | Summer - Fall 2017
## **Role** | Project Lead - Senior User Experience Designer
United Wholesale Mortgage is the largest Mortgage loan provider. They work closely with Loan Officers and forgo selling directly to the end borrowers. Fluid was contracted to help them engage their core audience of Loan Officers in a way that made their site a one-stop-shop when choosing where to take the end customers business. We dealt with their marketing and Engineering teams, using an agile approach. Our concept was to take a set of tools unique to UWM, used by their active customers, and bring some of that power and usefulness to their public homepage.

# **Initial** Research
After initial stakeholder interviews, we ran a content analysis on the site and showed the client the main content problem of bifurcation - that their marketing and tools were overly separated. By combining the two, we could make a more intuitive platform for users.

# **analysis and concept for content types**
From our initial research, we showed some of our analysis and an overarching content model. We identified main content types and proposed a zone structure.

# **ethnographies**
To understand our target audience, I ran ethnographic studies with a variety of loan officers in LA - their biggest market. These studies provided me the insight to find out what really would help a loan officer in their day-to-day business. We discovered the loyalty a good user experience could bring to their B2B relationships.

# **User Journey**
A big part of the challenge was dealing with users at various states, for this, we made user journeys in addition to breaking the site architecture up by logged in, logged out, and cookied users.

# **Navigation**
Instead of using analytics strictly to develop our navigation modal, we humanized it by making our navigation match the day of a loan officer. Following up on major categories, we created a module system for the mega menus, so that the site could grow over time.

# **From the whiteboard to Final Designs**
Because of the speed of this project and my history in visual design, we went in with a goal of high fidelity wireframes. We utilized sketches features, and from the smallest elements, I built the sketch file so that visual design could come in and replace generic styles, rather than building from scratch. I involved visual design as early in the process as possible, so that they could be in on the very first UI decisions.

# **Keeping it all together**
We managed a high level of complexity by utilizing a single source of reference for the entire team.  Confluence was used as an ever-changing wiki for requirements gathering, functional specs, design, and assets. The documentation structure was based on the site architecture and secondary structure on the atomic design model for the UI. The payoff came during transfer from design to engineering. Engineers could quickly move between tickets in Jira back through epics and stories to Confluence, and find all the information they needed from design.
