Was shocked to find the trail covered in snow in late March. While I had checked the weather and was prepared for the temperature with lows of 36 and highs of 45, I wasn’t prepared to trudge through snow. We made good pace despite the snow and only saw a couple and a lady out with her dog. Both groups were lost and just getting back on trail when we found them. I guess this shows how hard it is to navigate a white blazed trail or any color trail in winter. Lucky for us, I had GPS anytime we couldn’t find a blaze, though this only happened once for us on the AT. We got to Wiley Shelter around noon with plenty of time to go on to Ten Mile Shelter, but with the snow, we were content to setup our tents here and spend the rest of the day making a fire, cooking, and listening to AWOL on the AT audiobook broadcast from my phone.
