# **Appalachian Trail** 2018 Southbound
In 2018 I hiked the Appalachian Trail from Maine to Georgia in 112 days. This was the chance of a lifetime to spend a larger chunk of time experiencing the nature and people. I was humbled by the landscape I got to walk through everyday and the hikers and others along the way who helped me on my way. I started backpacking in 2016 and have found it to be a godsend for an introverted nature lover.
