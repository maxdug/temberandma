They are the largest. what sets them apart is  that they work closley with Loan Officers across the US and don't have a business unit that sells directly to the end borowwers. They are privatley owened by their CEO and their company culture was a very impressive open enviroment with a sports culture. They were a joy to work with, believing in never pointing fingers and being calm and steady through big project chalenges.This was working with a detroit based company which I probably went in and out of the detroit airport 5-6 times over the course of the project. We delt with their marketing and Engineering team with final presentations to the CEO Mat Ishbia as the final oversight.The concept coming into the project was to take a set of tools that set the client apart to their logged in active customers, and bring some of that power and usefulness to their homepage.
